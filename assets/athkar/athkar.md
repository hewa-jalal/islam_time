### **Rasulullah (ﷺ) said, “The best of salah after the obligatory salah, is the salah of the night (Qiyamullail).” (HR Muslim)**

Performing Qiyamullail is voluntary, and they have been described as the best of acts after the obligatory ones. One reason for this is Qiyamullail is an act that is hidden from people.

In a hadith, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: whoever gets up at night and says:
> لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ، وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ‏.‏ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ، وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ، وَلاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ، وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ، وَلاَ حَوْلَ وَلاَ قُوَّةَ إِلاَّ بِاللَّه 

And then says: “O Allah! Forgive me,” he will be forgiven. Or if he makes du’a to Allah, he will be responded to and if he performs ablution (and prays), his prayer will be accepted. 


# **The best things to do** 
## Prayers

As you prepare to do prayers, make an intention of performing it such as “I intend to pray Tahajjud 2 rakaat”. Do take note that any type of night prayers such as solat taubah, isthikharah etc..is also a form of Qiyamullail.

Repeat rakaats as you wish. Generally, two rakaats is seen as the minimum for Tahajjud. However, it's possible to repeat as many more, as you wish. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) frequently prayed up to 13 rakaats.

End your night prayers with “Witr” prayers. It is a prayer consisting of 3 rakaat with two salams. You can perform 2 rakaat of Witr prayers followed by the salam, then continuing it by another one rakaat of Witr, followed by the salam.

## Read some parts of Quran
 After you’re done with your night prayer, you may choose to read some parts of the Quran.
 
## Make istighfar
After finishing reading the Quran, complete it with your most sincere istighfar. In Surah Ali Imran between verse 15 to 17, Allah mentioned that “For those who fear Allah will be gardens in the presence of their Lord beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and purified spouses and approval from Allah” to a few groups of people, and one of those that Allah highlighted are “those who seek forgiveness before dawn”

> الصّابِرينَ وَالصّادِقينَ وَالقانِتينَ وَالمُنفِقينَ وَالمُستَغفِرينَ بِالأَسحارِ



It is they who are patient, sincere, obedient, and charitable, and who pray for forgiveness before dawn



## Du'a

Don’t forget to supplicate to Allah as this is the best time to ask Him for what your heart wishes. Ask away, don't be shy! He is closer to you than your jugular vein, and He will give you what is best for you, inshaAllah.
do not only make du’a for yourselves or for the worldly matters but make du’a for the next world and for your loved ones, your relatives, teachers and the world.
